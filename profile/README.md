<p>Purpose of <strong>Feedopt</strong> to provide social awareness. We had been living with each other in peace in this piece of overland until found modern life which is destroying their lands. We built gorgeous buildings and factories and destroyed everything because of our power desire. In this way, unfortunately, our friends cannot live on the street except a couple of countries  anymore. We are looking and feeding them our home. But sometimes some economic crisis or modern life, work, school etc. cannot allow this. This is the reason we are trying to find new family for our sweet friends. <strong>Feedopt</strong> is the best platform to adopt our friend or find your lovely pet.</p>

<h4>Adopt your lovely friends and Find your lovely pets</h4>

<p> <strong>Feedopt</strong> has been being developed since October 2021. <strong>Feedopt</strong> which developed with C# .net core as backend and React Native as mobile application aims to be the voice of animals. </p>
